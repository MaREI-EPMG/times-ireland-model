# Scen_B_RSD_UnitBoilers.xlsx

## Purpose
This workbook supports the TIMES Ireland model as part of **Residential and buildings**. It is used to define, adjust, or parameterize scenario assumptions and model behavior for its domain.

## Functional role in the model workflow
- Serves as an input artifact consumed by the model data-preparation process.
- Encodes structured assumptions that can vary by scenario, policy case, or technology pathway.
- Organizes data so updates can be managed without changing model code.

## Workbook structure
- Total worksheets: **3**
- Worksheets are grouped below by their likely functional theme based on sheet naming and content cues.

### General input tables
- **Cover**
  - Content cues: TIMES-Ireland Model; Document type:; Scenario; Sector(s):
  - Likely use: stores structured assumptions or mappings used during scenario assembly and model execution.
- **Regions**
  - Content cues: IE; National; IE-CW; IE-D
  - Likely use: stores structured assumptions or mappings used during scenario assembly and model execution.

### Technology definitions and performance
- **UC unit boilers**
  - Content cues: Linking Dwellings and Boilers; Note: This UC links the number of space heating appliances with the number of dwellings; ~UC_Sets: R_E: IE,National; ~UC_Sets: T_E:
  - Likely use: stores structured assumptions or mappings used during scenario assembly and model execution.

## User constraints and bounds
- No explicit user constraints with process-level mappings were identified in this workbook.

## Notes
- This documentation intentionally describes purpose and functionality without listing spreadsheet cell ranges.
- Naming suggests this file is part of a larger linked input set; keep workbook names and paths stable when integrating updates.
